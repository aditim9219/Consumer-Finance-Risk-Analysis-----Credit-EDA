# Credit-EDA
This assignment applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real business scenario, focusing on risk analytics in banking and financial services. It aims to demonstrate how data can minimize the risk of financial loss when lending to customers.

**Business Understanding:**
In the lending sector, the challenge lies in assessing loan applicants' creditworthiness, especially when they lack sufficient credit history. This scenario involves a consumer finance company specializing in urban customer loans. The goal is to use EDA to analyze data patterns, ensuring deserving applicants aren't overlooked while mitigating the risk of defaults.
The dataset includes loan applicant information categorized by payment behavior. Various loan application outcomes exist, such as approval, cancellation, refusal, and unused offers. The objective is to identify repayment difficulty patterns to inform loan approval decisions.

**Goal of the Case Study:**
This case study aims to identify patterns indicating potential repayment difficulties among loan applicants. Insights gained will guide actions like adjusting loan terms or denying loans to mitigate risks while ensuring deserving applicants aren't rejected. Understanding key factors driving loan defaults informs portfolio management and risk assessment strategies. Independent research on risk analytics is recommended for further insight.

**Data:**
The dataset consists of two files. The first file, '**application_data.csv**', contains comprehensive client information recorded at the time of application, encompassing details related to payment difficulties. The second file, '**previous_application.csv**', provides data concerning the client's previous loan applications. It includes information regarding whether these previous applications were Approved, Cancelled, Refused, or categorized as an Unused offer.

**Results Expected:**
To outline the analysis approach, starting with the problem statement. Missing data will be addressed using appropriate methods, outliers will be identified, and data imbalance will be assessed. Results of univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analysis will be explained in business terms, with correlation analysis conducted to find top correlations. Visualizations will be included to emphasize key findings and variables important for differentiating clients with payment difficulties from other cases.

**Documents Included:** The following have been included in the Case Study:
  1. A well documented Python file: **Credit_EDA_Assignment_CaseStudy_Final.ipynb**
  2. A presentation file: **Credit EDA Case study Assignment.pdf**
